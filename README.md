# Semantic Segmentation for Improved Cell Nuclei Analysis
This is the official GitHub repository of the above paper. Dataset preparation scripts will be made available in the future through this link, along with training, evaluation, exporting and visualisation scripts for every model used in the study.

Figures will be added with the final submission as they cannot be anonymised easily.

Until the final submission, additional resources for locating data and the metrics used in the paper will be listed below.

## Datasets
Four datasets were used in the writing of the paper.
- [MoNuSeg](https://monuseg.grand-challenge.org/Data/)
- [MoNuSAC](https://monusac-2020.grand-challenge.org/Data/)
- [CryoNuSeg](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ipateam/segmentation-of-nuclei-in-cryosectioned-he-images) - requires a kaggle account
- [TNBC](https://zenodo.org/record/2579118)

## Metrics
The metrics we have used for performance evaluation are:
- Intersection-over-union
- F1-score, also known as dice index.
- Object-level hausdorff-distance, retrieved from the [GlaS contest](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841516301542)
